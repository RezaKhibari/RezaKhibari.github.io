## My favourte Git command
As a mathematics enthusiast with a passion for computer programming and development, I am deeply invested in leveraging the power of Git to manage and collaborate on software projects. Among my favorite Git commands are init, remote, pull, push, and commit, each playing a crucial role in the version control process.
1. git init: This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. 
2. git remote: This command manages connections to remote repositories. It allows you to add, view, and remove remote repositories. For example, adding a remote repository named "origin"
3. git pull: This command fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch. For example, pulling changes from the remote repository's main branch:
4. git push: This command uploads local repository content to a remote repository. For example, pushing changes from the local repository's main branch to the remote repository:
5. git commit: This command records changes to the repository. It captures a snapshot of the changes staged using git add.
